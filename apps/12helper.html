	<h1>Manual for user</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>There are four main operations user can do in this application: Insert single thing (for example, add new player), update single row, delete single row or delete all rows of the table.
		Besides, user can see the visualised after change symbolic map, save map or load it, create new map, or select something from existing table (with sorting!) </li>
		<li>Clicking button "save" results in dumping database to ~/Downloads/mydba file. You can retrieve such database by giving absolute path to Your database to an application on a load screen</li>
		<li>Creating new map with given size creates new map unless user specified height or width of a map &gt;500 or &lt;1 </li>
		<li>Inserting given user's parameter inserts single row, if it obeys basic rules of of the game - two players cannot share same name, two castles cannot lie on the same point
			and more than two armies cannot lie on the same point</li>
		<li>Updating works analogously, but one cannot update non-existent row - what follows, without clicking on a certain row update does not work in any way.</li>
		<li>If user clicks on a row and THEN, without clicking on any other row/button clicks delete, then the row is deleted. If user doesn't provide the row, he is asked whether he
		would like to delete whole table content</li>
		<li>Deleting army implies destruction of all heroes and units (stored in army connect) connected with that army</li>
		<li>Deleting castle or updating it's type implies destruction of all buildings connected with this castle</li>
		<li>Deleting player implies destruction of armies associated with this player, heroes become neutral</li>
		<li>The estimation of power works in logarithmic scale, which is logical given the fact that map should show beginning of the game</li>
	</ul>
